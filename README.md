# Using R's Caret Package for Machine Learning
Talk given on Sept. 9, 2017 to [KC R Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/Kansas-City-R-Users-Group/).

After giving an overview of the Caret Package, machine learning results using the caret package compare performance of about a dozen models using the Forensic Glass dataset from the MASS package.
